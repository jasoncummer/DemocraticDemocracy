I think I have to release this now.
Its a work in progress and I'll try to get it to a new level.

The Idea is that every user in the system has an account(offically autherized),
and they have the ability to create new laws and alter the currents.
To create a new law some one starts it. Then a certain number of people will have to want to create that law voteing it over a threshold.

The laws have dynamic elements that will be calulated every x# of minutes to adjust the law. 

The laws can therfore be altered by the people any time and be best suited to the people at the time.



Warning:
Overly influential people or news networks may temporaly influence the laws. 
  This might be attenulated by adding different calulations times or voter number thresholds. 


Pluses:
Reduced reliance on polititians.
Laws that can be updated to relect the values of the poeple they serve.
