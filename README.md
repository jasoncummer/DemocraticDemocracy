# DemocraticDemocracy
D^2


Its a work in progress.

The Idea is that every user in the system can influence their democracy, their nation, their community. 
Every one gets a vote, their vote is counted in real time and can alter the output of the law they are voting for.Their vote can change if they change their mind and then that is taken into account.  

The system has users that have an offically authorized account.
Users have the ability to create new laws and alter the current laws, if they want to.
To create a new law, some one propses it. 
Then a certain number of people will have to want to create that law, voting it over a threshold. Threshold also set in general by the population of users.
When the law is over that threshold, some threshold that will give it a level of stability, it will be added to the next "update" of enforcable laws.

The laws have dynamic elements that will be calculated every x# of minutes to adjust the law. 

The laws can therfore be altered by the people any time and be best suited to the people at the time.

If the law becomes outdated users could petition to have it removed, if it gets voted out, its removed from the enforcable laws.



Warning:
Overly influential people or news networks may temporarily influence the laws.
  This might be attenulated by adding different calulations times or voter number thresholds.
As of 2025 I think we are past this threshold even for "traditional" democracy.
So new fixes for that need to be implemented.


Pluses:
Reduced reliance on politicians.
Laws can be updated to reflect the values of the poeple they serve in the current context.

Minus:
The reasons for laws may get lost. Chesterton's fence. 
Maybe mitigate with addition of metadata and or descriptions.
