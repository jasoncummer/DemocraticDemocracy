I think I have to release this now.
Its a work in progress and ill try to get it to a new level.

The Idea is that every one in the system has an account(offically autherized),
and they have the ability to create new laws if a certain number of people want to create that law.

The laws have dynamic elements that will be calulated every few minutes to adjust the law. 

The laws can therfore be altered by the people any time and be best suited to the people at the time.


Warning:
Overly influential people or news networks may temporaly influence the laws. 
  This might be attenulated by adding different calulations times or thresholds.
